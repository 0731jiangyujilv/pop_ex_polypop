/// mark) covering exactly those trades. The next `observeWindow` trades decide it:
/// the moment the probability comes back within `jumpThreshold` of the window's
/// anchor the shock REVERTED and every trade in it is refunded its 0.70% (net cost
/// 0.30%); if the observation window runs out with the market still displaced the
/// shock is TOXIC and the trades that pushed the probability in the shock's own
/// direction by more than `contribThreshold` forfeit their 0.70% to LPs (net cost
/// 1.00%). Counter-directional trades — the correctors — and same-direction trades
/// under `contribThreshold` are always refunded. A trade that slides out of the
/// lookback window without ever triggering a shock is refunded too.
