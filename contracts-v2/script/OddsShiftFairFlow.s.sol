///         shock, then corrects it, and every trade in the window gets its
///         0.70% protection fee back — a net cost of exactly 0.30%.
///
/// The shape, with the demo defaults (jump 5 points over 5 trades, contribution
/// line 1 point, observation 5 trades):
///
///   #0..#4   buyYes, +1.4 points each  -> net +7.0 -> the window is MARKED
///   #5       buyNo, all the way back to the anchor
///              -> the first observation trade is already inside anchor +/- 5
///              -> the shock closes REVERTED on the spot
///              -> #0..#4 all become RefundedReverted
///   #6..#9   four small buys, +0.875 points each (under the 1-point line)
///              -> #5..#9 form the next window, net -3.5, under the jump line
///              -> #5, the corrector, retires as RefundedNoShock too
///
/// Nothing is charged. The trader claims the whole escrow back at the end.
///
/// Precondition: the market's OddsShift queue must be EMPTY. Both flows leave
/// something behind — this one a four-trade tail, the toxic one an open shock —
/// and the plan below only holds when trade #0 of the climb starts a fresh
/// window. Run `--sig "finalize()"` on whichever flow ran last before starting
/// another; {OddsShiftFlowBase-_requireDrained} refuses the run otherwise.
