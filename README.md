# POP (ex PolyPOP)

PolyPOP turns live disagreement into prediction markets on X.
When users are already arguing, debating with friends, or seeing two clear sides to a question, they can tag @_PolyPOP to deploy an onchain prediction market directly from the conversation.

## One-Line Pitch

**PolyPOP is a social-to-market stablecoin workflow: social disagreement starts on X, Uniswap powers entry routing plus bootstrap liquidity, Arc hosts the market and settlement, and Chainlink resolves and protects sensitive value flows.**

---

## The Problem

Predictions already happen in conversations.

People argue all the time on X about prices, headlines, outcomes, and narratives. But most of those disagreements never become real markets because the user flow is too fragmented:

- the market is not created where the conversation happens
- users may not hold the right asset
- users may not be on the right chain
- settlement is often too heavy or too public
- large payouts and treasury movements expose too much onchain information

---

## The Solution

PolyPOP connects four layers into one clean flow:

1. **X as the social trigger** — a tweet, reply, or argument becomes the trigger for a market.
2. **Arc as the market and settlement layer** — the prediction market is created natively on Arc and settled in USDC.
3. **Uniswap as the user entry layer** — if the user only has ETH on Base, Uniswap converts it into USDC automatically.
4. **Chainlink as the resolution and privacy layer** — Chainlink CRE resolves the market, and Chainlink privacy capabilities handle large private payout or treasury flows.

---

## Demo Flow

### Step 1 — A disagreement starts on X
Two users publicly argue about an outcome on X.

### Step 2 — A market is created on Arc
PolyPOP turns that disagreement into an Arc-native prediction market.

### Step 3 — A user wants to join, but only has ETH on Base
The user does not need to manually prepare USDC.

### Step 4 — Uniswap converts ETH into USDC
PolyPOP uses the **Uniswap Trading API** to convert the user's ETH on Base into USDC.

### Step 5 — USDC is bridged to Arc
PolyPOP uses **Arc Bridge Kit** to move USDC from Base to Arc.

### Step 6 — The user joins the market on Arc
The market runs and settles natively on Arc in USDC.

### Step 7 — Chainlink resolves the market
A **Chainlink CRE workflow** verifies the outcome and writes the result onchain.

### Step 8 — Large flows can go private
If a user wins a large amount, or if protocol revenue grows, the payout enters a **privacy-preserving settlement lane** instead of exposing the full value flow publicly.

---

## Why This Design Matters

PolyPOP is not just a prediction market UI.

It is a **stablecoin-native market workflow** that solves three real frictions at once:

- **social friction** — markets should begin where the disagreement already exists
- **asset friction** — users should not need to already hold USDC
- **settlement friction** — high-value payouts should not always be fully public

---

## Uniswap Integration

Uniswap is used in **two distinct ways** inside PolyPOP.

### A. Base-side asset conversion

If a user wants to join a market but only holds **ETH on Base**, PolyPOP uses Uniswap to convert it into **USDC on Base** before the user enters Arc. This makes Uniswap a real part of the entry flow rather than a cosmetic add-on.

PolyPOP uses Uniswap for:
- **quote generation** for ETH → USDC
- **approval / execution preparation**
- **swap transaction construction and execution**

Uniswap handles the swap on Base. Bridge Kit + CCTP handles the movement of USDC into Arc. Uniswap does **not** bridge funds into Arc.

### B. Cold-start counterparty logic

PolyPOP is designed for live disagreement, which means the first user may arrive before the other side exists. **Uniswap v4 hooks** are used to handle this case by customizing the position lifecycle and counterparty logic.

When a user opens a position before the betting window closes:

1. the protocol temporarily seeds the opposite side
2. real counterparties can still enter during the open window and take the other side
3. if a real counterparty arrives, the protocol-seeded position is reduced, replaced, or swapped out
4. if the window closes without a real counterparty, the protocol remains the final counterparty

This makes the market usable from the very first interaction.
